# two-closest-problem
The program applies divide-and-conquer principle to find shortest distance of two points among unlimited amount of points;
Firstly, it generate random points, with both x, y coordinate random float number between 1-10;
Then, it implements algorithm to find the minimum distance.
The time complexity is O(NlogN), but O(N) space complexity due to sorting requirement.
